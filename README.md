# clj-dribble

This project is a solution of test assignment.

You have to create a tool to calculate Dribbble stats:

    For a given Dribbble user find all followers
    For each follower find all shots
    For each shot find all "likers"
    Calculate Top10 "likers"

This solution strictly follows recomendation of Dribbble 'It is possible for some resources in the future to not be paginated based on page number, so it is important to follow these Link header values instead of constructing your own URLs".
